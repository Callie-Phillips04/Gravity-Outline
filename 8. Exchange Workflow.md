## 8.2 Workflow and Managing Consent 

    Describes specification for consent resource.

    The following diagram depicts: 
    1. The patient interacts with the provider and takes a risk survey that creates the specific health concerns defined by the survey and the patient’s responses.
    2. The provider and patient determine which of the health concerns are valid, and “promote” the most important ones to the “problem list” to be addressed. The patient and provider may establish goals and agree on the specific referrals/interventions/exchanges (not depicted in this diagram). The patient provides consent to share information with the relevant organizations.
    3. The Provider’s System provides (via a FHIR API) the ability to share information with
        - CBO
        - CP
        - Payer
