# 3. SDOH Clinical Care Background 

## 3.1 SDOH Clinical Care Scope 
The Gravity Project focus for this version of the IG is to standardize the exchange of SDOH information related to the following activities:

1) assessment of social risk,

2) establishing coded health concerns/problems,

3) creating patient driven goals, and

4) defining a RESTful closed loop referral process to manage interventions.

- Narrtative that describes the SDOH domains rather than the above diagram 
- Link to current list of domains [SDOH Domains ](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GRAV/Terminology+Workstream+Dashboard)

- The scope of interactions plan to cover all the interactions below.. 

*There is no explanation to this diagram, it is a littler premature, still haven't been introduced to these actors what does scope of interactions mean?* 

                            *Insert Diagram 2*

    3. Addressing Consent beyond sharing to HIPPA 

*Does this belong in background, is this out of scope for diagram2*

## 3.3 Data Modeling Framework 
                        *Insert Diagram 4*
